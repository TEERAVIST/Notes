Day trading focuses on short-term trades within a single trading day. The goal is to profit from small price movements by entering and exiting trades frequently.

#### 20 Successful Day Trading Strategies:

1. **Scalping:** Making very short-term trades for small profits, typically a few seconds to minutes.
2. **Momentum Trading:** Entering trades when an asset shows strong momentum in one direction.
3. **Breakout Trading:** Buying when an asset breaks above resistance or selling when it breaks below support.
4. **Pullback Trading:** Entering a trade after an asset makes a temporary pullback in the direction of the trend.
5. **Reversal Trading:** Taking positions when a trend seems to be reversing after exhaustion (e.g., using candlestick patterns like Doji or Engulfing).
6. **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) Strategy:** Trading based on the VWAP, often used as a support/resistance level.
7. **News-Based Trading:** Trading based on news releases that cause a strong price movement (earnings, economic reports).
8. **Gap and Go:** Buying assets that gap up in price on news or earnings and continuing with the trend.
9. **Fading the Gap:** Trading against large price gaps that often revert back to previous levels.
10. **Channel Trading:** Trading within a defined price range (buying at support and selling at resistance).
11. **Relative Strength Index (RSI) Overbought/Oversold:** Trading based on RSI readings, buying when it's oversold (below 30) and selling when it's overbought (above 70).
12. **Bollinger Band Breakouts:** Entering when prices break out of the Bollinger Bands.
13. **Moving Average Crossovers (Golden/Death Cross):** Trading when a shorter-term moving average crosses a longer-term moving average.
14. **Fibonacci Retracement:** Using Fibonacci levels to identify possible reversal points for entering trades.
15. **Trendline Breaks:** Using trendlines to identify breakout points for entering trades.
16. **Pivot Point Strategy:** Using pivot points to determine key support and resistance levels for entry and exit.
17. **Stochastic Oscillator:** Using overbought and oversold conditions to identify buy and sell signals.
18. **Inside Bar Breakout:** Trading breakouts from inside bars (candlestick pattern) when the market is consolidating.
19. **Price Action Trading:** Trading purely on price patterns without indicators, such as candlestick formations and support/resistance levels.
20. **Market Making:** Providing liquidity by buying and selling at certain price levels to profit from the spread.
