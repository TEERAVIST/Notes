- **Swing trading** involves holding assets for several days to weeks, aiming to profit from short- to medium-term price movements (swings).
- **Profit Expectations:**
    - **Per Day:** Swing traders are typically not concerned with daily returns, as their trades last several days. However, they might target **0.5% to 2% per trade** depending on the timeframe and market conditions.
    - **Per Month:** A swing trader might aim for **5% to 15% monthly returns**, though this can vary. Some swing traders might achieve higher returns during volatile market conditions or with leverage.
    - **Risk:** Like day trading, swing trading involves risk, but typically with more stable returns, as trades are held over longer periods.
