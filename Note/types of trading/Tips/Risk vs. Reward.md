Itâ€™s essential to understand that with higher **expected returns** comes **higher risk**. Aiming for aggressive profits without proper risk management can lead to significant losses. Many traders who claim to make extraordinary returns have likely experienced periods of substantial drawdowns as well.

### Compounding Effect:

The **compounding effect** is critical to growing capital over time. Even modest monthly returns can lead to significant growth if reinvested. For example:

- **1% per day** compounded over 20 trading days (1 month) gives approximately **20% return**.
- If you were to consistently achieve this over a year, it would result in over **600%** return. But this is rare, and markets are unpredictable.
