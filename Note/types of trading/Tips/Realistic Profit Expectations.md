While many traders dream of making **huge profits** in a short time, it’s important to have **realistic expectations**. Here’s a range of possible outcomes:

- **Conservative Traders (e.g., Swing or Position Traders):** These traders might realistically target **5% to 15% per month** over the long term.
- **Aggressive Traders (e.g., Day Traders):** These traders might target **10% to 20% per month**, but this comes with much higher risk and a greater chance of significant drawdowns or losses.
- **Professional/Algorithmic Traders:** High-frequency or algorithmic traders might aim for **1% to 5% per month** on average, with many trades executed to achieve modest but consistent gains.
