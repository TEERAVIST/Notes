**Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**, developed by Harry Markowitz, uses mathematics to build an optimal portfolio that maximizes expected return for a given level of risk. It involves calculating the **correlation** between assets, their **covariances**, and using **efficient frontier** analysis to determine the best mix of assets.

Key concepts:

- **Risk/Return Tradeoff:** Understanding the balance between risk and return for an asset or portfolio.
- **Diversification:** Reducing risk by holding a mix of uncorrelated assets.
