Traders use statistical methods to analyze market data, model returns, and forecast price movements. Some important statistical concepts in trading include:

- **[[Regression Analysis]]:** Used to identify relationships between variables (e.g., price and volume, or price and time). Linear regression is one common method.
- **[[Probability and Distribution]]:** Traders use probability distributions (e.g., normal distribution) to model price returns and risk. They calculate the probability of an asset reaching a certain price in a given time frame.
- **[[Monte Carlo Simulations]]:** This technique uses random sampling to simulate a wide range of potential price outcomes and helps assess the risk of a trading strategy.
- **[[Variance and Standard Deviation]]:** Measures of volatility, showing how much an asset's price fluctuates over time.
