Algorithmic trading (or **algo trading**) uses mathematical models and computer algorithms to automate trading decisions. These algorithms can use complex mathematical formulas to:

- Identify trading signals.
- Execute trades at optimal times to maximize profits.
- Implement strategies like **market making**, **arbitrage**, and **statistical arbitrage**.

Algorithmic traders might use **machine learning** algorithms to improve predictions and decision-making based on historical data.
