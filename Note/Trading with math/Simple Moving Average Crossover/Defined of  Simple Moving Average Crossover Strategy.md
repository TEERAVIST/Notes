Hereâ€™s a simple example of a mathematical strategy for trading based on moving averages:

- **Buy Signal:** When the short-term moving average (e.g., 50-day MA) crosses above the long-term moving average (e.g., 200-day MA).
- **Sell Signal:** When the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

Mathematically, this involves calculating the moving averages of the asset prices over specific periods and comparing them.
