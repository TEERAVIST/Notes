In trading, managing risk is critical. Mathematical formulas are often used to calculate the amount of capital to risk on each trade, as well as to assess the overall portfolio risk.

- **[[Kelly Criterion]]:** A mathematical formula used to determine the optimal size of a trade based on the probability of winning and the risk-reward ratio.
- **[[Value at Risk (VaR)]]:** A risk management tool used to estimate the potential loss in a portfolio over a given time period for a given confidence interval.
- **[[Expected Value (EV)]]:** A method for calculating the expected return of a trading strategy, incorporating both the probabilities of outcomes and their potential profits or losses.
