Technical analysis relies on historical price and volume data to predict future market movements. Some of the most common mathematical methods used in technical analysis are:

- **[[Moving Averages (MA)]]:** A method of smoothing price data to identify trends over a specific period (e.g., 50-day or 200-day moving averages).
- **[[Exponential Moving Average (EMA)]]:** A weighted moving average that gives more importance to recent data.
- **[[Relative Strength Index (RSI)]]:** A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, helping traders identify overbought or oversold conditions.
- **[[Bollinger Bands]]:** A volatility indicator that uses a moving average and standard deviation to set upper and lower price bands.
