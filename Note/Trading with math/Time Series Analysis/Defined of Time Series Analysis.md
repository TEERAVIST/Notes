Time series analysis is the study of data points indexed (or listed) in time order. In trading, this involves analyzing historical prices to detect trends, cycles, and seasonality. Techniques include:

- **[[Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)]]:** A method for forecasting time series data.
- **[[Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)]]:** A more advanced moving average that gives more weight to recent data, often used to model volatility.
