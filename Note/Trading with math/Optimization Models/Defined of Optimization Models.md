In algorithmic trading, optimization is used to fine-tune trading strategies. Some common optimization techniques are:

- **[[Linear Programming]]:** Solving optimization problems where you maximize or minimize a linear objective function, subject to constraints.
- **[[Genetic Algorithms]]:** A heuristic search algorithm inspired by natural selection, used to find optimal trading strategies.
- **[[Simulated Annealing]]:** A probabilistic optimization technique that can be used for finding a good trading strategy in a large solution space.
